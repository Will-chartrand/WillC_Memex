### Summary & Key Take Aways

Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a videogame which encapsulates the idea of failure, but explores topics such as culture and the internet while doing so. The development of the internet effectively shifted information from that of a commodity to disposable. The effects of   integrating such media into our society produces a culture which is constantly fleeting, devalued, and incomprehensable.
