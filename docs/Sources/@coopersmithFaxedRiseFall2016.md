### Summary & Key Take Aways

The first developments of facsimile involved three major countries: The United States, Europe and Japan. There were prodominantly two forms of facsimile being used. Picture Telegraphy was the first to become popular because the newspaper companies were willing to pay a premium for pictures to use in their prints. By 1930, faxing helped transform the "visual culture" of newspapers and their readers. Faxing for businesses faced challenges and strong competition from telegraphy and mail that stifled further development. The failures of fax technology could be in part attributed to misconceptions in the news and technological prematurity. Although the technology did have many investors, the developments just weren't enough to keep it relevant.
