### Summary & Key Take Aways

Early inventions like the wireless and successful experiments of radiotelephony over  
time merged with business interests to create the powerful radio broadcast industry of  
modern day. This chapter addresses the key developments and uses of radio. Beginning  
with Marconi's successful transmission of the letter "S" from England to Newfoundland  
in 1898, the timeline continues with Fessenden's 1906 successful Christmas Eve  
radiotelephony transmission from Brant Rock in Massachusetts--the first publicly  
announced broadcast. Other key historical developments of radio's timeline include the  
pioneer broadcast station KDKA in Pittsburgh; the formation of the networks and the  
creation of the radio audience; radio's golden age of programming; the development of  
FM radio; and the impact of television on the radio industry. Technological  
advancements are important because they ensure the continued viability of radio.  
However, these developments must be considered in the light of the role of radio in  
society. Technological advancements are vital but this must not overshadow the fact  
that such developments occur in order to serve society. Radio serves society in a variety  
of capacities: education, entertainment, military affairs, and public affairs such as news  
and politics. Land-grant universities once envisioned radio as a powerful tool for  
educating mass numbers of the population. Educational radio stations numbered more  
than 200 during the early 1920s but dropped to 35 by 1941 due to the lack of funding

The first radiotelephony broadcast served an entertainment purpose and consisted of  
Fessenden playing the violin as well as playing phonograph recordings. Musical artists  
continue to entertain the public through radio. During World War I, the United States government took control of radio airwaves by ordering amateur operators off the air and  
authorizing the Navy to exert complete control of what was perceived as a marine  
service. In 1920 private ownership was restored. During World War II, the American  
government limited the licensing of new radio stations. Political radio broadcasting  
began early in the United States during the late 1930s, with political candidates airing  
radio advertisements. Political radio became a staple of American society as early as  
1944 when, due to poor health, FDR relied predominantly on radio to run his fourth  
successful presidential bid. On election night in 1944, the radio networks dropped  
regular programming in order to carry the election results. Political radio continues  
today with recent and current presidents' weekly radio broadcasts and an extensive  
variety of talk radio shows.  

Broadcast journalism developed during World War II. Edward R. Murrow, considered  
to be the founder of broadcast journalism, became famous for his eloquent and vivid  
broadcasts describing the bombing of London by Hitler's warplanes. Listeners became  
so engrossed in Murrow's news coverage that they actually felt as if they were there and  
experiencing the terror in London. Countries use radio to project their policies and  
values onto other nations. Future technological advancements include the evolution into  
digital radio, the increasing value of micro-powered radio stations, and the future of  
radio and the Internet
