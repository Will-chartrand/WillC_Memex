>The multiple human needs and desires that demand privacy among two or more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead to cryptology wherever men thrive and wherever they write. Cultural diffusion seems a less likely explanation for its occurrence in so many areas, many of them distant and isolated” (Kahn 1967, p. 84).

Something that wasn't current in the 18th century. From a blog post:
I have been asked by my superiors to give a brief demonstration of the surprising effectiveness of even the simplest techniques of the new-fangled _Social Networke Analysis_ in the pursuit of those who would seek to undermine the liberty enjoyed by His Majesty’s subjects. This is in connection with the discussion of the role of “metadata” in [certain recent events](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-prism-server-collection-facebook-google) and the assurances of [various respectable parties](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/why-metadata-matters) that the government was merely “sifting through this so-called metadata” and that the “information acquired does not include the content of any communications”. I will show how we can use this “metadata” to find key persons involved in terrorist groups operating within the Colonies at the present time. I shall also endeavour to show how these methods work in what might be called a _relational_ manner.

Sometimes it's the pattern of communication that's key


The pattern of how the message moves is also important with cryptoanalysis

Polybius square:
Write the alphabet out, and you can use signal torches. The first postition of the torch indicates the row, the second position indications the column

When you look into this you always come across the 'scytale'
Prof thinks it's stupid.
wrap leather around a rod and write message on it. Rod needs to be a certain thickness for you to read it.

> One way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the "first", the next most occurring letter the "second", the following most occurring letter the "third", and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the "first" letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the "second" letter, and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the "third" letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.

Meanwhile, in Europe:
- Roger Bacon (13th century) describes various systems of secret writing known to him; make also have encrypted the secret of the Philosopher's Stone in the same description using a grille (piece of card with holes cut out, fits over the page, reveals letters/words)
- Otherwise, fairly behind

Early Modern Europe (16th to about 1800 ish)
-   Remember, intro of a new information technology in Europe (moveable type) is also a marker for this period
-   faster circulation of ideas
-   new ideas around relationship of people to God, to each other, nature of government, what is a state, anyway... all these things up for discussion
-   coinciding with the European age of discovery too...
