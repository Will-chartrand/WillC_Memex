We're talking about electricity

Lots of animals make electricity
- Electric catfish in the nile
- A lot of animals use magnetism which is part of the same force.

Luigi Galvani 1737-1798. The calipers - one part made of brass, the other part with iron; had been interested in what happened to the legs in the presence of lightenning, but the legs would twitch when the two prongs touched the nerve. Felt that this was indicative of an 'animal force'
(Shown diagram of frog with electrode in leg)

>On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened.

> In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion. Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons' Company, who was officially present during this experiment, was so alarmed that he died of fright soon after his return home.

Let's talk about what the Greeks were doing before this frog stuff:

What is it:
The precise use of the word 'electric' and 'electricity' varies over the centuries, but starts getting used more or less in our sense in 16th, 17th century. Many individual observations over the years to do with attraction versus repelling, and the seeming interaction with magnets; all of it very mysterious. William Gilbert in 16th century observed how static electricity could attract a needle/lodestone; he framed it in the language of the 'humours' of the body, and especially as 'exhalation' - there's always been a connection between electricity and life, even when we didn't actually know that there **was** a connection between electricity and life.

Can we store it?
1746, Pieter van Musschenbroek invents the Leyden jar - crazy set up. He was trying to capture static electricity - has a glass phial or jar of water, hanging from a gun barrel by a wire through the cork in the top, where the wire goes into the bottle; gun barrel is suspended by silk near glass balls that have been thoroughly rubbed up full of static electricity. The assistant touches the phial, gets a terrible amplified shock - we now call this a capacitor, a device for storing up electricity for release

How fast does electricity flow?
Jean Antoine Nollet, also in 1746 wants to know how fast this electric force can travel. Arranges for 200 monks to stand in a circle, each holding one end of a metal rod which combined gives the circle a 1 mile radius. Then he electrified one of the monks by getting him to touch a Leyden jar (recently invented), hoping to see how fast the effect traveled by the monk's reaction. He had to conclude travels vritually instantly! Does the same thing again with 180 royal guards for the edification of Louis XV. Science!

Ben Franklin, roughly the same time, notices that an iron point can conduct electricity away from a charged iron sphere; does his famous kite experiment to demonstrate that static electricity and lightening are of the same kind of thing; develops lightening rods to protect buildings and ships

The idea that the stuff travels instantly, and can be channeled in various ways is emerging. People start using fluid metaphors.

There starts to develop the idea that something is moving, like a fluid.

Alessandro Volta, 1745-1827 becomes aware of Galvani's experiments, and disagrees vehemently with him - V notes that experiment was with different medals through a moist body (recently deceased) - argues that the electrical current was a function of the interplay of moisture and the two different metals, NOT some innate animal force. To prove this, experiments and finds if he arranges two different kinds of metals in a pile of wet/dry/wet etc he can induce electricity to flow - calls this the 'pile'. Which we now call a 'battery'. 1800

Implication: we can now experiment with a constant current rather than static - which helps kick start systematic experiments and obersvation & research into electricity.

While I haven't described them, many researchers also noting the way electricity influences/influence by magnetism.  
-Orsted works out some of the relationship of flowing electricity to magnetic fields, can deflect a nearby needle - people immediately start thinking 'hot damn we could make a telegraph out of this!'

-   Faraday shows that a magnet can induce electricity in 1831; but over in the US, engineer Joseph Henry discovered this at roughly the same time (but Faraday published first and more fully)
-   Henry goes all in on electromagnets, builds a commerical one that can lift 750 pounds, sells a version useful for separating iron ore.

---

Henry invents - or rather, is one of several people to invent independently - the **relay**, a device through which one electrical circuit could control another. His party trick was a 1.5 mile circuit of wire that could trip a little hammer to ring a bell; another similar was a way of causing an electromagnet to suddenly demagnetize, dropping its load

Telegraphs
- You can't just string a wire up from A to B
- You have to take into account how the electricity flows
- Messages at a distance became feasible once this was solved

-   important to note that with electricity you have to think about what Henry and others called 'quantity' and 'intensity' to make electricity travel for long distances; if you wired up a lot of batteries to a magnet, you could pump enough electricity to do work at a distance.
-   for railways, you need to be able to coordinate who's on the same set of tracks so you don't collide

---

...and now all the pieces are in place.

We can:

-   store electricity
-   induce electricity to travel
-   induce changes in some device at point B by alternating the electricity at point A
-   and because we know magnetic fields and electricity are connected, compass needles are really easy to move with magnetic fields generated by electricity

there is a _lot_ out there on the history of electricity. Especially the 18th and 19th centuries, things get intense. But if you want to know the details about how everything actually _works_, you can find lots of material pretty fast.

What I do want you to think about are the ways today's story could've intersected with monday's, with last week's, other sessions. Every story I tell necessarily leaves things out. This is why your note **making** matters, why you, if you consider yourself an educated person, **must** seek out more information, more pieces of the puzzle. Triangulate! Today's story could not have happened without the industrial revolution. Could not have happened without the professionalization of what it means to experiment, to communicate scientific, industrial, engineering knowledge. These people knew or knew of each other, followed their work... what other technologies/emergent social structures had to exist?
