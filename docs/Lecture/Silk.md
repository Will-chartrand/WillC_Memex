Weaving is a social practice. It happens in the context of many other people. 
They may have used to sing songs to keep a rhythm while weaving.

Flax (linen) is an even more ancient material than wool

Linen would be decorated to a degree but it's more something you dye. 

pretty expensive

---
Silk is also awfully expensive
3500-2500 BCE

Originated in china 

apparently takes about 6000 cocoons to make 1kg of silk

Very strong fabric, takes colour very well. Can be made into very light clothing

---

The silk road was from Europe to Asia, where silk was exported from Asia.

Weaving terms:
- Warp - the verticle threads, held in tension
- Weft - the horizontal threads
- Shed - the space created when some warp threads are lifted up
- Shuttle - A wooden block used to pull the weft threads through the shed
- Comb - pushes the threads tight together once the shuttle has passed through
- Drawloom - Enables individual warp threads to be drawn up

Implications of Drawloom?
- 2 person set up
- slow - care, feeding, value?
- how much land devoted to flax, to bulberries, to sheep, etc.?
- Reproducability?
- Training?
- Think in terms of assemblages, things coming together

Silk trade in Lyon

Francois the first really wants silk.
Wants to give money to people who can improve the machines and processes used to make it.

Even by the 18th century, it was a two man job to make silk.
Mostly men were weaving. 
Approx 30k people in the 19th century Lyon who weaved as their job.

Jacques de Vaucanson - 1709 - 1782

- Made a robot duck that could poop
- Also made a flute player
- An automata that played the tambourine 

He eventually turns to the problem of the loom
This man reasoned that he could take one of the mechanisms from a music player (the ones you wind)

The teeth would engage a hook that would life a thread, so it could make repeated patterns.
A few of these machines got built but it never really caught on.

Joseph-Marie Jacquard, 1752-1834
![[jacquard-silk-portrait.jpg]]
This is not a painting, it was made on a loom, with 24000 cards

This guy's life bracketed the french revolution. 
It was very much a monarchist city (Lyon)

Napoleon

Put huge effort into fostering technical innovation, scholarly innovation, rationalisation.
When he invades egypt he brings a lot of academics to study their antiquities. 

Since silk was the largest export industry, a lot of money was dumped into it in hopes for a lot of ROI to fund the military.

He was able to patent a loom that uses foot pedals for a loom. We wins a medal.
Wins a fishnet making thing using the loom. 

1804 -- he devised a mechanism which can change individual threads.

Did Jacquard invent the punch card?
- No - Louis Faucon/Falcon in 1728, but in his arrangment, the draw boy had to hold the card in place manually; Faucon improving an idea by his master Basile Bouchon using a paper tape with holes in it

Did Jacquard invent automatic lifting of threads?
- No - Vaucanson's metal cylinders could do that

What did he invent?
- An approach that applied threaded together punch cards to the automatic control of the loom
	- 24x speed increase (i.e. 2 feet per day)
	- Replicable patterns, complex patterns, multiple machines producing identical swaths of silk

What really matters about Jacquard's invention are the *cards*, not the loom

Charles Babbage
Difference Engine / Analytical engine
- 'difference' becuase it uses the method of differences to calculate tables by adding the differences between items in a series. But had to be set up manually: no cards

>"**_We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leavesâ€¦_**" - Ada Lovelace

- Depends upon cards to enter data, output data, store instructions
