Vannevar Bush states that it does, but I would disagree with this statement.

As individuals rely more heavily on technology that they lack the capacity to recreate or even repair on their own, their environment becomes limited in the sense that their it is tailored to things of which they do not *really* own. I would define ownership as something of which you have *full* control over, as well as it being your property. In the case of the modern phone, of course you're able to communicate with people all over the world, but this comes with the caveat of having a phone plan, which can be taken away from you at any moment, which is interfaced to you with a firmware that is purposely designed to be limiting and used in a very specific way (i.e. the IPhone), and it most certainly comes with the caveat of having your [privacy completely and utterly compromised](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB436/docs/EBB-097.pdf). This begs the question of whether the *owner* owns the phone more than the phone company owns the individual. 

Overall, modern technology may be able to give one additional freedom, though almost always at the expense of their *freedoms*.
