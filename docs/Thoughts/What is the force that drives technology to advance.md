This or more or less me trying to derive an answer to this question by thinking it through as opposed to linking an article about it.

Technology seems to have an incessant need for imprisonment. As technological advance continues, the whole system becomes increasingly reliant on these new technologies. In addition to the average person now being locked into technology use that they have very little say over, the rules and regulations governing these products of advancement rule over the people. In short, what you own starts owning you.

An example of this would be the car. We planned our environment around the automobile by making our cities more sparse, and now they have become mandatory to effectively function in this society.

Though what is a society if not the sum of its individuals? These happenings don’t just take place on the macro level. We can observe it in ourselves; our own goals.

The effective society is run more or less by those who are disciplined enough to keep a job, and that requires them to not give into addiction. These are the people who are more likely to have offspring that function in society just as well. This society (as should any) selects for those who excel at self-governance. Those who are able to sacrifice their freedoms for their future, and perhaps indirectly for the greater good. The “greater good”, however, is a very vague term. It would make sense in my eyes to define it as the aiming at or achievement of the collective goal(s) of the society. Well, what is the _goal_ of the society if not the sum of the goals of the individuals of said society?

**The forces of society that govern the individual are a result of the mechanism by which the naturally selected individual governs themself.**

It seems that the easiest way to stop technological supremacy would be to kill the human spirit.
