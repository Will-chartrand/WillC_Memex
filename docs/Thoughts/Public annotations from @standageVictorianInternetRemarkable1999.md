> "The Atlantic is dried up, and we become in reality as well as in wish one country. The Atlantic Telegraph has half undone the Declaration of i776 , and has gone far to make us once again, in spite of ourselves, one people."
>
>> What are the societal effects of having such a form of instantaneous communication between the countries? Do the societies become less dissimilar?

#### Relevant / important

> "Fancy a shark or a swordfish transfucing his fins upon the insulated wires, in the middle, perhaps, of the Atlantic, interrupting the magic communication for months," wrote one skeptic.

>> There are clearly many things that can go wrong with the transatlantic telegraph lines, and this is just one possibility

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Portraying himself as a man of science struggling against the forces of ignorance and incompetence, he blamed the manufacturers of the cable, the crew of the ship that laid it, and, most of all, Cyrus Field and the other officials of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, who he claimed had refused to let him carry out all the tests he recommended.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Conveniently for the Atlantic Telegraph Company, which ought to have taken some of the blame for rushing the manufacture of the cable, the responsibility for the failure could be laid firmly at Whitehouse's door. With him gone, the company argued, the mistakes that had caused the cable to fail would never be repeated.

>> Through the use of a scapegoat, the Atlantic Telegraph Company was able to get a second chance

#### Disagree

> [!quote|#ff6666] Highlight
> "Since the discovery of Qolumbus, nothing has been done in any degree comparable to the vast enlargement which has thus been given to the sphere of human activity."

>> As someone who has been brought up in a time where inter-continental communication was fast and effective, it's difficult to imagine just how drastically the lives of these people changed as a result of such a development.

#### Agree

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> Some even claimed the whole thing had been a hoax-that there had never been a working cable, and it was all an elaborate trick organized by Field to make a fortune on the stock market.
>
>> Having the cable only work for a month definitely would have made me question either the competence of the people involved or if this had even succeeded at all.
