The calipers - one part made of brass, the other part with iron; had been interested in what happened to the legs in the presence of lightenning, but the legs would twitch when the two prongs touched the nerve. Felt that this was indicative of an 'animal force' (Shown diagram of frog with electrode in leg)</p> <p>On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened.</p> <p>In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion. Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons' Company, who was officially present during this experiment, was so alarmed that he died of fright soon after his return home. Newgate Calendar</p> <p>Let's talk about what the Greeks were doing before this frog stuff:</p> <p>What is it: The precise use of the word 'electric' and 'electricity' varies over the centuries, but starts getting used more or less in our sense in 16th, 17th century. Many individual observations over the years to do with attraction versus repelling, and the seeming interaction with magnets; all of it very mysterious. William Gilbert in 16th century observed how static electricity could attract a needle/lodestone; he framed it in the language of the 'humours' of the body, and especially as 'exhalation' - there's always been a connection between electricity and life, even when we didn't actually know that there was a connection between electricity and life.</p> <p>Can we store it? 1746, Pieter van Musschenbroek invents the Leyden jar - crazy set up. He was trying to capture static electricity - has a glass phial or jar of water, hanging from a gun barrel by a wire through the cork in the top, where the wire goes into the bottle; gun barrel is suspended by silk near glass balls that have been thoroughly rubbed up full of static electricity. The assistant touches the phial, gets a terrible amplified shock - we now call this a capacitor, a device for storing up electricity for release</p> <p>How fast does electricity flow? Jean Antoine Nollet, also in 1746 wants to know how fast this electric force can travel. Arranges for 200 monks to stand in a circle, each holding one end of a metal rod which combined gives the circle a 1 mile radius. Then he electrified one of the monks by getting him to touch a Leyden jar (recently invented), hoping to see how fast the effect traveled by the monk's reaction. He had to conclude travels vritually instantly! Does the same thing again with 180 royal guards for the edification of Louis XV. Science!</p> <p>Ben Franklin, roughly the same time, notices that an iron point can conduct electricity away from a charged iron sphere; does his famous kite experiment to demonstrate that static electricity and lightening are of the same kind of thing; develops lightening rods to protect buildings and ships</p> <p>The idea that the stuff travels instantly, and can be channeled in various ways is emerging. People start using fluid metaphors.</p> <p>There starts to develop the idea that something is moving, like a fluid.</p> <p>Alessandro Volta, 1745-1827 becomes aware of Galvani's experiments, and disagrees vehemently with him - V notes that experiment was with different medals through a moist body (recently deceased) - argues that the electrical current was a function of the interplay of moisture and the two different metals, NOT some innate animal force. To prove this, experiments and finds if he arranges two different kinds of metals in a pile of wet/dry/wet etc he can induce electricity to flow - calls this the 'pile'. Which we now call a 'battery'. 1800</p> <p>Implication: we can now experiment with a constant current rather than static - which helps kick start systematic experiments and obersvation &amp; research into electricity.</p> <p>While I haven't described them, many researchers also noting the way electricity influences/influence by magnetism. -Orsted works out some of the relationship of flowing electricity to magnetic fields, can deflect a nearby needle - people immediately start thinking 'hot damn we could make a telegraph out of this!'</p> <ul> <li>Faraday shows that a magnet can induce electricity in 1831; but over in the US, engineer Joseph Henry discovered this at roughly the same time (but Faraday published first and more fully)</li> <li>Henry goes all in on electromagnets, builds a commerical one that can lift 750 pounds, sells a version useful for separating iron ore.</li> </ul> <p>Henry invents - or rather, is one of several people to invent independently - the relay, a device through which one electrical circuit could control another. His party trick was a 1.5 mile circuit of wire that could trip a little hammer to ring a bell; another similar was a way of causing an electromagnet to suddenly demagnetize, dropping its load</p> <p>Telegraphs - You can't just string a wire up from A to B - You have to take into account how the electricity flows - Messages at a distance became feasible once this was solved</p> <ul> <li>important to note that with electricity you have to think about what Henry and others called 'quantity' and 'intensity' to make electricity travel for long distances; if you wired up a lot of batteries to a magnet, you could pump enough electricity to do work at a distance.</li> <li>for railways, you need to be able to coordinate who's on the same set of tracks so you don't collide</li> </ul> <p>...and now all the pieces are in place.</p> <p>We can:</p> <ul> <li>store electricity</li> <li>induce electricity to travel</li> <li>induce changes in some device at point B by alternating the electricity at point A</li> <li>and because we know magnetic fields and electricity are connected, compass needles are really easy to move with magnetic fields generated by electricity</li> </ul> <p>there is a lot out there on the history of electricity. Especially the 18th and 19th centuries, things get intense. But if you want to know the details about how everything actually works, you can find lots of material pretty fast.</p> <p>What I do want you to think about are the ways today's story could've intersected with monday's, with last week's, other sessions. Every story I tell necessarily leaves things out. This is why your note making matters, why you, if you consider yourself an educated person, must seek out more information, more pieces of the puzzle. Triangulate! Today's story could not have happened without the industrial revolution. Could not have happened without the professionalization of what it means to experiment, to communicate scientific, industrial, engineering knowledge. These people knew or knew of each other, followed their work... what other technologies/emergent social structures had to exist?

As a middle-schooler, Getting Over It's exploration into how our society has changed really spoke to me in a way that I had never experienced before. It had taught me to not give up, even when it becomes increasingly easy to. Hearing him talk about how information is fleeting, along with our attention, and at the same time presenting a mountain to climb made me set my mind on finishing the game. This was more or less out of spite - \"My attention span is such that I can overcome difficult challenges that don't promise results at any stage of the process and I will prove it even if it's the last thing I do\". So it took over eight hours to complete the game.  The mountain has very few safe points, so the player is constantly in danger of falling right back to the start; this happened very often, but the fact that this failure was consciously added to the game kept me going for some reason.

This chapter addresses the key developments and uses of radio. Beginning with Marconi's successful transmission of the letter \"S\" from England to Newfoundland in 1898, the timeline continues with Fessenden's 1906 successful Christmas Eve radiotelephony transmission from Brant Rock in Massachusetts--the first publicly announced broadcast. Other key historical developments of radio's timeline include the pioneer broadcast station KDKA in Pittsburgh; the formation of the networks and the creation of the radio audience; radio's golden age of programming; the development of FM radio; and the impact of television on the radio industry. Technological advancements are important because they ensure the continued viability of radio. However, these developments must be considered in the light of the role of radio in society. Technological advancements are vital but this must not overshadow the fact that such developments occur in order to serve society. Radio serves society in a variety of capacities: education, entertainment, military affairs, and public affairs such as news and politics. Land-grant universities once envisioned radio as a powerful tool for educating mass numbers of the population. Educational radio stations numbered more than 200 during the early 1920s but dropped to 35 by 1941 due to the lack of funding</p> <p>The first radiotelephony broadcast served an entertainment purpose and consisted of Fessenden playing the violin as well as playing phonograph recordings. Musical artists continue to entertain the public through radio. During World War I, the United States government took control of radio airwaves by ordering amateur operators off the air and authorizing the Navy to exert complete control of what was perceived as a marine service. In 1920 private ownership was restored. During World War II, the American government limited the licensing of new radio stations. Political radio broadcasting began early in the United States during the late 1930s, with political candidates airing radio advertisements. Political radio became a staple of American society as early as 1944 when, due to poor health, FDR relied predominantly on radio to run his fourth successful presidential bid. On election night in 1944, the radio networks dropped regular programming in order to carry the election results. Political radio continues today with recent and current presidents' weekly radio broadcasts and an extensive variety of talk radio shows.  </p> <p>Broadcast journalism developed during World War II. Edward R. Murrow, considered to be the founder of broadcast journalism, became famous for his eloquent and vivid broadcasts describing the bombing of London by Hitler's warplanes. Listeners became so engrossed in Murrow's news coverage that they actually felt as if they were there and experiencing the terror in London. Countries use radio to project their policies and values onto other nations. Future technological advancements include the evolution into digital radio, the increasing value of micro-powered radio stations, and the future of radio and the Internet</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40spikerDevelopmentRadio/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Put any links to separate notes you have teased out here.</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999/","title":"@standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999","text":"<p>Title: @standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999 date: 2023-03-04 type: reference project:</p> <p>tags:: #PartTwo projects:</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Standage, Tom.

The answers lose their meaning if they are elaborated without reference to the questions, as has been the case in much contemporary theory. An example is the Hobbesian question of how men become tractable to social controls. The two-fold answer of contemporary theory is that man \"internalizes\" social norms and seeks a favorable self-image by conforming to the \"expectations\" of others. Such a model of man denies the very possibility of his being anything but a thoroughly socialized being and thus denies the reality of the Hobbesian question. The Freudian view of man, on the other hand, which sociologists have misrepresented, sees man as a social though never a fully socialized creature.

Jonathan Coopersmith recounts the multigenerational, multinational history of the device from its origins to its workplace glory days, in the process revealing how it helped create the accelerated communications, information flow, and vibrant visual culture that characterize our contemporary world. Most people assume that the fax machine originated in the computer and electronics revolution of the late twentieth century, but it was actually invented in 1843. Almost 150 years passed between the fax's invention in England and its widespread adoption in tech-savvy Japan, where it still enjoys a surprising popularity. Over and over again, faxing's promise to deliver messages instantaneously paled before easier, less expensive modes of communication: first telegraphy, then radio and television, and finally digitalization in the form of email, the World Wide Web, and cell phones. By 2010, faxing had largely disappeared, having fallen victim to the same technological and economic processes that had created it. Based on archival research and interviews spanning two centuries and three continents, Coopersmith's book recovers the lost history of a once-ubiquitous technology. Written in accessible language that should appeal to engineers and policymakers as well as historians, Faxed explores themes of technology push and market pull, user-based innovation, and \"blackboxing\" (the packaging of complex skills and technologies into packages designed for novices) while revealing the inventions inspired by the fax, how the demand for fax machines eventually caught up with their availability, and why subsequent shifts in user preferences rendered them mostly passe</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2016/#annotations","title":"Annotations","text":"<p>%% begin annotations %%</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2016/#imported-on-2023-03-08-207-pm","title":"Imported on 2023-03-08 2:07 pm","text":""},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2016/#questions-confusion","title":"Questions / confusion","text":"<p>[!quote|#ffd400] Highlight facsimile</p> <p>What is the definition of Facsimile?</p> <p>Page 1 [[2023-03-05#11:31 am]]</p> <p>[!quote|#ffd400] Highlight Faxing even became a visible component in Japanese techno-imperialism in China</p> <p>What the hell is techno-imperialism??

Therefore, this study utilized the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which has more accurate norms and frequent usage among dual diagnostic patient populations. An on-line survey administered on a World Wide Web site utilized the BDI as part of a larger study. A total of 312 surveys was collected with 259 valid profiles from addicted users, which again supported significant levels of depression to be associated with pathological Internet use. This article discusses how a treatment protocol should emphasis the primary psychiatric condition if related to a subsequent impulse control problem such as pathological Internet use. Effective management of psychiatric symptoms may indirectly correct pathological Internet use.</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40youngRelationshipDepressionInternet1998a/#annotations","title":"Annotations","text":"<p>%% begin annotations %%</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40youngRelationshipDepressionInternet1998a/#imported-on-2023-02-09-634-pm","title":"Imported on 2023-02-09 6:34 pm","text":""},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40youngRelationshipDepressionInternet1998a/#relevant-important","title":"Relevant / important","text":"<p>[!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight moderate to severe rates of depression coexist with pathological Internet use.</p> <p>This was characteristic of an individual who used the internet for only 8 hours a week.
